The Respository contains the R & Python Code for Linear Regression Model.
The File used is placed in the folder.Open the R/Python Code with the directory setup correclty and you should be able to execute the code.

The R Code is more advanced in the sense it has repitition of steps which are actually required for the Linear Regression Model. 

The Python Code on the other hand implements only the required steps for building the model, as I have already learnt about the data 
beforehand using R Code. However, i have tried to bring in the code for all necessary steps in Python too.
